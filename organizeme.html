                            15-minute interviews with 10 students. To gain insights from a broader perspective, I

                        <h3>
                            The ideation process for "Organize Me" commenced with the implementation of the "Crazy 8"
                            method, followed by conventional brainstorming sessions. This initial phase aimed to
                            generate diverse concepts efficiently.

                            To further enrich the ideation process, external sources such as Pinterest, magazines, and
                            existing applications were explored for inspiration regarding color schemes, typography, and
                            overall design aesthetics. These platforms facilitated the gathering of visual stimuli,
                            aiding in the formulation of potential directions for the app's design.

                            Specific focus was placed on analyzing color combinations, font styles, and overall ambiance
                            to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface. This phase primarily emphasized
                            the extraction of design elements rather than subjective expressions of creativity.

                            Through methodical selection and refinement, the ideation phase culminated in the
                            establishment of a distinct vibe for "Organize Me," aligning with its intended purpose and
                            target audience.

                            In summary, the ideation process for "Organize Me" prioritized systematic exploration and
                            extraction of design elements from various sources, resulting in the development of a
                            coherent and visually engaging concept for the app's portfolio.

                        <h3>
                            My next step was wireframing — a step where I'm sketching out the basic structure before
                            diving into detailed design. This helps me focus on the essential features, making sure the
                            app is easy to use. Once I've got the wireframes, I can quickly test them with users to
                            catch any issues early on, making sure the app is user-friendly and accessible as I move
                            towards the final version."

                                    <h3>After creating wireframes for Organize ME, I decided to gather feedback from
                                        friends and family by having them test it out. Their input was invaluable, as it
                                        highlighted areas that needed improvement. For instance, some found certain
                                        features confusing or difficult to navigate. As a result, I went back to the
                                        drawing board, refining the wireframes based on their feedback. This iterative
                                        process led to a more user-friendly design that better aligned with the needs
                                        and expectations of potential users.</h3>

                        <h1>First Prototypes</h1>

                        <h3>While adhering to the wireframing phase, I noticed elements that required
                            adjustment or didn't aesthetically align with my vision. This involved several
                            rounds of refining designs, color combinations, and layouts. On the left side, I
                            gathered earlier components and color schemes for comparison. Each adjustment
                            aimed for a balance between aesthetics and functionality. This iterative process
                            allowed for the development of a cohesive prototype, ensuring each element
                            served its purpose effectively.

                        <h3>The development of Organize ME was an enlightening journey that underscored the importance
                            of iterative design and user feedback. Starting from initial brainstorming sessions to
                            creating detailed personas, every step was driven by a commitment to understanding and
                            addressing user needs. Testing with friends and family provided crucial insights that
                            refined the app's functionality and usability. Although the documentation wasn't planned to
                            be as thorough, and some parts may be missing or not perfectly described, the project
                            successfully resulted in a user-friendly, efficient tool for managing tasks, projects, and
                            schedules. This project not only honed my skills in UX design but also reinforced the value
                            of empathy and user-centered design in creating meaningful digital solutions.
